// This test is to confirm math errors with the xc32-gcc optimizer
//
// In general, the problem exists when using int8_t
//   (it may also exist with other small integer types, this is untested)
//
// e.g. 
//  uint8_t power = 127;
//  int8_t direction = -1;
//  < some code that doesn't always explicitly modify power or direction >
//  int16_t signedPower = (int16_t)power * (int16_t)direction;
//
//  Depending on the circumstances, the int8_t may act as though it
//  is of a larger type that hasn't been properly casted.
//
//  e.g. signedPower = power * direction    may result in:
//       signedPower = 127 * 255 (0xff) = 32385
//  when it should be:
//       signedPower = 127 * -1 (0xff) = -127
//
// This program has determined that the error 
//   (int8_t being treated as a larger integer type) 
//  also occurs in other circumstances, 
//  e.g. in a simple "printf()" statement.
//
// This was discovered on a PIC32MX230F064
// and is now being tested on a PIC32MX170F256


// RA0 is used as an indicator LED
// RB15 is the UART1 TX output, used as stdout at 9600bps







//#######   TEST CONFIGURATION OPTIONS   ########


//####### PRINT_IT_FUNCTION #########
//
//  When PRINT_IT_FUNCTION is defined (and TRUE),
//   PRINT_IT() is a function.
//  When PRINT_IT_FUNCTION is NOT defined,
//   PRINT_IT() is a macro.
//
// WHEN CALLED AS A MACRO:
//  Printout shows several bugs:
//   Bug1: PRINTOUT: 'PRId8' of (int8_t)dir=-1 results in '255'
//         (in certain cases, as seen).
//   Bug2: MATH: (power*dir)=(127 * -1) results in 32385
//         This is not just a printout error, this math is *used*
//
// WHEN CALLED AS A FUNCTION:
//  Printout is different
//  (Likely due to loading into new registers)
//  BUG2, from above, still occurs, showing that MATH IS WRONG,
//   And, *used* as-such.
//
// COMMENT OR UNCOMMENT AS DESIRED:
//#define PRINT_IT_FUNCTION 1


//#######  INCLUDE_RAND  #######
//
//  When INCLUDE_RAND is defined (and TRUE),
//   the variable 'dir' is assigned a new value on a random basis
//   This Intentionally SELDOMLY occurs (almost never).
//   The point is to demonstrate that the math-error does not present
//   itself unless the value of the variable 'dir' *might be* changed.
//  When INCLUDE_RAND is NOT defined,
//   The variable 'dir' is never reassigned a different value.
//   Printout and values are as-expected.
//
//  THUS: Presumably, the error does not present itself without this piece
//   of code DUE TO the optimizer's ability to recognize that it could work
//   with constants and never actually assign the (int8_t) value to a 
//   register.
//
//  Then, Presumably: Once the register is used, the value appears to be 
//  treated as the larger-type. Likely the registers' native 32-bit type.
//  FINE (right?) EXCEPT: the value -1 should then be assigned to the 
//  register as 0xffffffff. Instead, it seems to be assigned as 0x000000ff.
//
//NOTE: IF INCLUDE_RAND is not defined (and true), 
//      THEN MATH AND PRINTOUTS WORK AS EXPECTED
// COMMENT OR UNCCOMENT AS DESIRED:
